<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A fairly wide range of technical skills was being tested here, between python programming, docker usage or even SQL; though it probably took me a little bit over a full day's work, the test itself was actually very enjoyable as I had to recall some skills that I hadn't practiced in a long time.
